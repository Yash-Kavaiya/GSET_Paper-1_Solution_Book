Here are the questions, correct answers, and detailed solutions for the GSET December 2024 Paper-I, cross-referenced with the provided final answer key1.

Question 1
Question: Semantic barrier in communication is
Options:
(A) Use of technical/difficult language
(B) Use of technology
(C) Lack of attention
(D) Lack of co-ordination

Correct Answer: (A) Use of technical/difficult language 2

Detailed Solution:
Semantic barriers relate to the meanings of words and symbols. If a sender uses technical jargon, complex vocabulary, or words with multiple meanings that the receiver does not understand, the message is not decoded correctly. This is a linguistic hurdle, unlike "Lack of attention" (Psychological barrier) or "Use of technology" (Physical/Channel factor).
Question 2
Question: The key purpose of effective communication is
Options:
(A) Create barriers
(B) Promote misunderstanding
(C) Effect change
(D) Confuse audience

Correct Answer: (C) Effect change 3

Detailed Solution:
The ultimate goal of effective communication is to influence the receiver—whether to inform, persuade, motivate, or build relationships. This influence is intended to effect change in knowledge, attitude, or behavior. Options A, B, and D are counter-productive to communication.
Question 3
Question: Identify the correct sequence of the elements in the communication system.
a. Speech
b. Speaker
c. Receiver
d. Effect
Options:
(A) b, a, c, d
(B) a, b, d, c
(C) b, a, d, c
(D) c, d, b, a

Correct Answer: (A) b, a, c, d 4

Detailed Solution:
This sequence follows the classic Aristotelian model of communication:
Speaker (b): The source who generates the message.
Speech (a): The message itself.
Receiver (c): The audience who listens/reads.
Effect (d): The impact or result of the communication on the receiver.
Therefore, the order is b → a → c → d.
Question 4
Question: Which of the following is an example of non-verbal communication?
Options:
(A) Writing on the blackboard
(B) Speaking on microphone
(C) Sending a voice message
(D) Nodding head to indicate disagreement

Correct Answer: (D) Nodding head to indicate disagreement 5

Detailed Solution:
Non-verbal communication involves conveying meaning without words (spoken or written).
(A), (B), and (C) involve words (Verbal/Oral/Written).
(D) Nodding (or shaking) the head is a gesture (Kinesics), which is a form of non-verbal communication.
Question 5
Question: 'Encoding' in the communication system means
Options:
(A) Converting thoughts or ideas into a message
(B) Translating messages into ideas or thoughts
(C) Providing opinions on the sender
(D) Avoiding difficult words in the message

Correct Answer: (A) Converting thoughts or ideas into a message 6

Detailed Solution:
Encoding is the process where the sender transforms their abstract thoughts, feelings, or ideas into communicable symbols (words, gestures, pictures) to create a message. The reverse process, where the receiver interprets the symbols back into thoughts, is called Decoding (Option B).
Question 6
Question: Which one among the following is the common language for AI?
Options:
(A) Lisp
(B) Python
(C) PHP
(D) JAVA

Correct Answer: (B) Python 7

Detailed Solution:

iii. Due to ICT based governance, workforce gets reduced.
Options:
(A) i, ii and iii
(B) i and ii only
(C) i and iii only
(D) ii and iii only

Correct Answer: (A) i, ii and iii 8

Detailed Solution:
i. True: ICT makes data accessible, increasing transparency.
ii. True: E-governance involves automating workflows to improve efficiency.
iii. True (in context): Digitization often leads to the optimization of human resources and a reduction in manual/redundant workforce requirements.

Question 10
Question: Assertion (A): 'Touch screen' is considered as both input and output device.
Reason (R): 'Touch screen' can send data and receive data at the same time.
Options:
(A) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)
(B) Both (A) and (R) are true but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A)
(C) (A) is true but (R) is false
(D) (A) is false but (R) is true

Correct Answer: (A) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A) 11

Detailed Solution:
A touch screen displays visual information (Output/Receiving data from computer) and allows the user to interact by touching it (Input/Sending data to computer). Because it handles both the sending (input) and receiving (output) of data simultaneously, it is classified as an Input/Output device.
Question 11
Question: Which of the following components fall under presage stage of presage-process-product model of teaching-learning process?
Content analysis
Learning testing
Classroom interaction
Learning outcome plan
Learning supervision
Learner's motivation
Options:
(A) 1, 4, 6
(B) 2, 3, 5
(C) 1, 5, 6
(D) 1, 4, 5

Correct Answer: (A) 1, 4, 6 12

Detailed Solution:
In the Presage-Process-Product (3P) model (e.g., Biggs):
Presage factors exist before the learning event. This includes student characteristics (e.g., Learner's motivation) and the teaching context design (e.g., Content analysis, Learning outcome plan).
Process factors happen during learning (e.g., Classroom interaction, testing).
Product factors are the outcomes (e.g., Grades).
Therefore, 1, 4, and 6 fit the Presage stage.
Question 12
Question: Discussion method of teaching does NOT have the advantage of developing
Options:
(A) Understanding and experiencing
(B) Reflective level of experiencing
(C) Active learning
(D) Organisation of content flow in a structured sequence

Correct Answer: (D) Organisation of content flow in a structured sequence 13

Detailed Solution:
The Discussion method is open-ended, student-led, and dynamic. While it promotes active learning (C) and reflection (B), its main disadvantage compared to a Lecture method is that it often lacks a structured sequence or organized flow of content, as discussions can go off on tangents.
Question 13
Question: A teacher through experience found that learners were able to memorise and recall content, if given in brief summarised form. Of the given below which one is NOT the implication?
Options:
(A) Brief summarisation will motivate learner for active participation
(B) Brief summarisation will improve understanding and conceptualisation
(C) Brief summarisation will focus on memorisation irrespective of understanding
(D) Brief summarisation is key for cognitive learning

Correct Answer: (C) Brief summarisation will focus on memorisation irrespective of understanding 14

Detailed Solution:
The question asks for the option that is not a valid implication of the finding. Summarization aids memory by organizing information (cognitive learning), which typically supports understanding. Suggesting that it focuses on memorization irrespective of understanding (i.e., rote learning) is a negative interpretation that contradicts the effective pedagogical use of summaries.
Question 14
Question: The online teaching has advantage with reference to
Options:
(A) use of multimedia system
(B) well structuring of teaching
(C) objective based teaching
(D) all of the above

Self confidence
Absence of teacher clarification
Logical arguments for clarification
Classroom noise by learners
Peer attention seeking argument
Access to large amount of digital material on net
Options:
(A) 1, 2, 5
(B) 2, 4, 6
(C) 3, 4, 6
(D) 2, 4, 5

Correct Answer: (D) 2, 4, 5 16

Detailed Solution:
Disturbances are negative factors:
(4) Classroom noise is a direct disturbance.
(5) Peer attention seeking disrupts the flow.
(2) Absence of teacher clarification (interpreted here as a breakdown in the communication loop caused by the learner not asking/receiving clarity, or resulting in confusion that disturbs the class).
Options 1 (Confidence) and 3 (Logical arguments) are positive. Option D is the best fit for "disturbances".
Question 16
Question: In the following series of numbers, one number is wrong: 864, 420, 200, 96, 40, 16, 6. Which is the wrong number?
Options:
(A) 40
(B) 96
(C) 200
(D) 420

Correct Answer: (B) 96 17

Detailed Solution:
Let's analyze the pattern working backward from 6:
$6 \times 2 + 4 = 16$
$16 \times 2 + 8 = 40$
$40 \times 2 + 12 = \mathbf{92}$ (The series has 96)
$92 \times 2 + 16 = 200$ (Matches the next term)
$200 \times 2 + 20 = 420$
$420 \times 2 + 24 = 864$
The number 96 is wrong; it should be 92.
Question 17
Question: The difference between compound and simple interest on a certain sum... at 10% per annum for 1.5 years is 183 (compounded semi-annually). What is the sum?
Options:
(A) 19,200
(B) 24,000
(C) 35,000
(D) 38,060

Correct Answer: (B) 24,000 18

Detailed Solution:
Rate $R = 10\%$ p.a. Time $T = 1.5$ years.
Simple Interest (SI): $10\% \times 1.5 = 15\%$
Compound Interest (CI - Semi-annual):
New Rate = $5\%$. Time = 3 half-years.
Total CI % = $(1.05)^3 - 1 = 1.157625 - 1 = 15.7625\%$
Difference: $15.7625\% - 15\% = 0.7625\%$
Equation: $0.7625\%$ of Sum = $183$
Sum = $\frac{183}{0.007625} = 24,000$.
Question 18
Question: What will be the number of females above poverty line in the State D if it is known that the population of State D is 7 million?
Options:
(A) 2.87 million
(B) 2.43 million

(D) 1.98 million

Correct Answer: (B) 2.43 million 19

Detailed Solution:
(Note: The data table required for this calculation was missing from the input, but the answer is verified against the official key.)
Based on standard logic for such problems: You would take total population (7M) $\times$ (% Above Poverty Line) $\times$ (Ratio of Females in Above Poverty group). The result is 2.43 million.
Question 19
Question: Members of Cricket Club only: 5%, Football Club only: 15%, Both: 75%, Non members: 40. Number of students in both clubs?
Options:
(A) 450
(B) 500
(C) 550
(D) 600

Correct Answer: (D) 600 20

Detailed Solution:
Total Union (At least one club): $5\% (\text{Only C}) + 15\% (\text{Only F}) + 75\% (\text{Both}) = 95\%$.
Non-members: $100\% - 95\% = 5\%$.
Total Students: If $5\% = 40$, then $100\% = 800$.
Both Clubs: $75\%$ of $800 = 0.75 \times 800 = \mathbf{600}$.

$\frac{(9-5)^2}{1/6} = \frac{16}{1/6} = 16 \times 6 = 96$
$U - X = -2 - (-4) = -2 + 4 = 2$
Sum = $2 + 96 + 2 = 100$.
$\sqrt{100} = \mathbf{10}$.
Question 32
Question: If CI on a sum at $16\frac{2}{3}\%$ for 3 years is 1270, what is SI on same sum?
Options:
(A) 1,080
(B) 2,010
(C) 2,410
(D) 2,560

Correct Answer: (A) 1,080 33

Detailed Solution:
$R = 16 \frac{2}{3}\% = \frac{1}{6}$.
Let Principal $P = 6^3 = 216$.
CI for 3 years on 216:
Yr 1: 36
Yr 2: $36 + 6 = 42$
Yr 3: $36 + 6 + 6 + 1 = 49$
Total CI Units = $36+42+49 = 127$.
Given CI = 1270. So, $127 \text{ units} = 1270 \Rightarrow 1 \text{ unit} = 10$.
Principal $P = 216 \times 10 = 2160$.
SI = $P \times R \times T = 2160 \times \frac{1}{6} \times 3 = 2160 \times 0.5 = \mathbf{1080}$.

Detailed Solution:
Sum = $44 \times 3 = 132$.
$y = 2x \Rightarrow x = 0.5y$
$y = 3z \Rightarrow z = \frac{1}{3}y$
Sum: $0.5y + y + 0.33y = 132 \Rightarrow \frac{3y + 6y + 2y}{6} = 132$.
$\frac{11y}{6} = 132 \Rightarrow y = \frac{132 \times 6}{11} = 12 \times 6 = 72$.
Largest number is $y = \mathbf{72}$.
Question 35
Question: 10% died, 20% of remaining left. Population now 5040. Original?
Options:

(B) 7000
(C) 8000
(D) 9000

Correct Answer: (B) 7000 36

Detailed Solution:
Let Original = $P$.
After deaths: $0.9P$.
After leaving: $0.9P \times (1 - 0.20) = 0.9P \times 0.8 = 0.72P$.
$0.72P = 5040 \Rightarrow P = \frac{5040}{0.72} = \mathbf{7000}$.
